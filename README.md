# todolist-web-application
Created a dynamic to-do list web application through Node, Express, Javascript, EJS, and Mongoose. I hosted the server on Heroku and connected this to MongoDB Atlas (using AWS) in order to have data persist. 

You can access the hosted server through this URL:
https://still-falls-29973.herokuapp.com/

To create multiple to-do lists, add an extension to the URL such as 
https://still-falls-29973.herokuapp.com/school or 
https://still-falls-29973.herokuapp.com/work

With the database, your lists will be saved.
